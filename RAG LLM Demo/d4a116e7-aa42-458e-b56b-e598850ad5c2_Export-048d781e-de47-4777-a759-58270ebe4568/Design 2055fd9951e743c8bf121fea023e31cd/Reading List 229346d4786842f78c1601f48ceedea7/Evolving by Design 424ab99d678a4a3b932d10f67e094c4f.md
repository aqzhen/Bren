> We believe design needs to be represented at the executive level as it plays a critical role in how we accomplish our mission, and that there needs to be a single person responsible for connecting the dots between the software, content, and creative we produce as a team.

A brand/style guide does some of these things, but a human goes a long way to making sure execution grows with the organization!

> And, as we continue to grow, it’s important to have a CDO leading the transformation towards a single customer journey that encompasses content, marketing, and our product. Ultimately, if your organization uses design as a core tool to solve problems, make decisions, or highlight opportunities, you should have a CDO.

Sounds like Labs 😊

> There are six major organizational factors that influence how people work and behave in an organization: Vision/Strategy, Structure/Roles, Leadership, Talent/Development, Process, Space/Rituals.
