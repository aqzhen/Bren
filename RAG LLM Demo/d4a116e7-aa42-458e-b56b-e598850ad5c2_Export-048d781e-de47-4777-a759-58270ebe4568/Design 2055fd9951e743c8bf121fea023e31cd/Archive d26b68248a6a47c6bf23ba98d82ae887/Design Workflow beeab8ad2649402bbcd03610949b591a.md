# Design Workflow

## Sketch

Create mockups, maintain Symbols with reusable components. 

## Zeplin

Handoff to developers

## Team Drive

This is where our assets live: logos, marketing posts, other graphics, style guide.

We'll start doing a monthly drop of working Sketch files into the design folder, just so that we keep the files safe somewhere and they're not floating around solely on individual laptops. Don't stressâ€”these drops do NOT have to be perfect! They're just for safety and continuity's sake.
