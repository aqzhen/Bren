## Slack

Join `#design` on Slack! This is where we any Labs member can request feedback on designs, talk about design out in the world, and share design resources.

Also, request to be added to `#design-ppl` and the `@designers` user group if you haven't already! Both these groups are exclusive to designers in Labs.

- `#design-ppl` is used to plan our check-ins, discuss more specific feedback, and build a design community
- `@designers` is used to notify all designers of a message (generally used for requesting design help or delegating design-related tasks)
