Design Team Structure

- Is UI/UX design + graphic design structure working?
    - @Jess Tan: both graphic designers requested more UI/UX (perhaps roles with more overlap/flexibility?)
- What are other role divisions/structures we can try?
    - @Jess Tan: imo titles aren't the most important, but it's helpful for knowing the scope of responsibilities
- all are product designers, maybe look out for brand designer
