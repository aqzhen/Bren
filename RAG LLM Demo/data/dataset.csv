Penn dates its founding to 1740, when a plan emerged to build a Philadelphia charity school that would double as a house of worship. After construction was underway, however, the cost was seen to be much greater than the available resources, and the project went unfinished for a decade.
In 1749, Benjamin Franklin—printer, inventor, and future founding father of the United States—published his famous essay, “Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth,” circulated it among Philadelphia’s leading citizens, and organized 24 trustees to form an institution of higher education based on his proposals. The group purchased the building and in 1751, opened its doors to children of the gentry and working class alike as the Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania. Franklin served as president of the institution until 1755 and continued to serve as a trustee until his death in 1790.
Franklin’s educational aims, to train young people for leadership in business, government, and public service, were innovative for the time. In the 1750s, the other Colonial American colleges educated young men for the Christian ministry, but Franklin’s proposed program of study was much more like the modern liberal arts curriculum. His fellow trustees were unwilling to implement most of his then-radical ideas though, and Penn’s first provost, William Smith, turned the curriculum back to traditional channels soon after taking the helm from Franklin.
In addition to challenging the educational conventions of the day, Franklin pushed boundaries that moved science and society forward and helped shape America’s very nationhood. He was a member of the Second Continental Congress, a drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, and played a pivotal role in recruiting French aid for the Americans during the Revolutionary War. Franklin later signed the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the conflict with the British Empire.
His broad knowledge spanned multiple disciplines, and far from regarding it as an end in itself, he saw knowledge as an asset that required practical application to be of value. His many essential inventions range from bifocals and the lightning rod to the iron furnace stove and odometer.
Beyond that, the civic institutions that Franklin helped launch include the country’s first subscription library (1731) and first hospital (1751), in addition to what would become America’s first university, the University of Pennsylvania, in 1749.
In the years that followed, Penn went on to obtain a collegiate charter (1755), graduate its first class (1757), establish the first medical school in the American colonies (1765) and become the first American institution of higher education to be named a university (1779). In 1802, the University expanded to another campus, but by the 1860s had outgrown even that space, so in 1872 the trustees built a new campus in the street-car suburb of West Philadelphia.
To this day, Penn’s 299-acre West Philadelphia campus reflects its rich heritage—a heritage closely bound with the birth of the United States—boasting more than 180 buildings and many notable landmarks, including the nation’s first student union and first double-decker college football stadium.
The 190 research centers and institutes on campus also reflect the University’s innovative, civic-minded, and pragmatic creator: More than 250 years after Ben Franklin broke new ground in founding Penn, its faculty, students, and alumni continue to make breakthroughs in research, scholarship, and education. Its many subsequent “firsts” include the world’s first collegiate business school (Wharton, 1881); the world’s first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer (ENIAC, 1946); and the first woman president of an Ivy League institution (Judith Rodin, inaugurated in 1994). Rodin was succeeded by Amy Gutmann, inaugurated in 2004, and then M. Elizabeth ""Liz"" Magill, inaugurated in 2022.
From campus walkways engraved with Franklin’s words of wisdom to the University’s most important strategic initiatives such as the Penn Integrates Knowledge Professorships, the President’s Engagement Prizes, and the President’s Innovation Prizes, Penn continues to educate and inspire future leaders to move our now-global society forward.

A message about Penn’s endowment and sustainability
President Liz Magill and Board of Trustees Chair Scott L. Bok
November 29, 2022
The world gathering in Egypt for COP27 reminds us of the urgency of our collective fight against climate change. Faculty, student, and staff attendees from Penn represent the energy and talent that so many Penn community members contribute to this crucial effort. This is an opportune moment to share our thoughts on the role of Penn’s endowment in combatting climate change. The complexity of the issue and the urgency of the climate challenge merit a thoughtful consideration and explanation of Penn’s policies.
Penn’s endowment exists to provide long-term support for Penn’s educational mission. This year, Penn will spend a record $960 million from its endowment to support student financial aid, faculty salaries, faculty teaching and research, Penn’s health system, and countless other programs that rely heavily on endowment spending. While the core purpose of Penn’s endowment is to provide this financial support, some have argued that large endowments should play a role in mitigating climate change and, in particular, that fossil fuels do not have a place in university endowments.
Penn’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions within the endowment
The Office of Investments has established the goal of reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions from Penn’s endowment investments to zero by 2050. Penn Today speaks with Chief Investment Officer Peter Ammon about Penn’s new climate goal and the challenges that will need to be overcome in order to achieve it.",Securing a Sustainable Future,"A message about Penn’s endowment and sustainability President Liz Magill and Board of Trustees Chair Scott L. BokNovember 29, 2022"
https://www.upenn.edu/about/sustainability/climate-investments,"Toward Net Zero
In April 2021 the Penn Office of Investments announced its goal of reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions from Penn’s endowment investments to zero by 2050.
To maximize the impact of our efforts, we will pursue our net-zero goal in a manner that contributes to the decarbonization of the real economy. We will therefore engage with the investment managers with whom we partner, lending our voice and support as they encourage their portfolio companies to develop and follow sustainable decarbonization plans. We expect that progress toward the endowment’s net-zero goal will primarily occur through emissions reductions at the many hundreds of companies in which the endowment is invested.
In addition, the Office is actively pursuing investment strategies that will help fund the transition from a high-carbon to low-carbon economy. The energy transition will require huge amounts of capital, creating significant investment opportunities over the coming decades. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to make investments that not only generate strong returns for Penn but also contribute to real world decarbonization.
Achieving net zero is a massive and complex goal. We are fortunate to be able to collaborate with Penn faculty experts, with our investment partners, and with other institutional investors who share similar aims. Achieving our goal will also inevitably depend on the commitment of governments to meet emissions reductions goals, on the development of technologies that will support a decarbonized economy, and on significant changes in consumer behavior.
We are excited to be part of the global effort to solve the greatest challenge of our generation. We look forward to updating the community over time as we progress in our overall efforts.",Climate Investments,Toward Net Zero In April 2021 the Penn Office of Investments announced its goal of reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions from Penn’s endowment investments to zero by 2050.

Through energy efficiency, recommissioning, carbon offsets, and a cleaner electricity grid, Penn has made immense progress towards achieving the 100 x 42 goal of carbon neutrality by 2042.
As of the close of FY22, overall emissions have been reduced by 45% and building-related emissions have been reduced by 45% compared to the FY09 baseline.
As part of Penn’s Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), two large solar facilities in Central Pennsylvania are under construction. These solar facilities will account for an estimated 70% of electricity for Penn’s main campus and the University’s Health System (UPHS) when they come online in early 2024.

Messages from President Magill, Penn Board of Trustees, and other Penn leaders.
“We are all members of the Penn community, and we all deserve to be heard and respected. But hateful speech has no place at Penn.”Penn President Liz Magill
Messages from President Magill, Penn Board of Trustees, and other Penn leaders.
During times of crisis, University leaders are committed to supporting, engaging, and communicating with our community. Here are the facts around Penn’s response and actions.
Guidance from a free speech expert and scholar and Penn’s Student Code of Conduct.
Campus-wide resources for safety, health, and support.
On Nov. 1 President Liz Magill launched Penn’s Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism in a message to the Penn community. A whole-University approach, anchored in the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, the Plan centers on three broad areas: Safety and Security, Engagement, and Education. Initiatives, both immediate and longer term, will direct Penn to provide for the safety and security of every member of the University community, engage deeply and meaningfully with the Jewish community and the broader Penn community to develop solutions to call out and combat antisemitism, and ensure that everyone at Penn is educated and knowledgeable about antisemitism.
Penn Public Safety is paying very close attention to the information circulating regarding the safety of our community and takes their safety and any threats very seriously.
As part of our planning, Penn’s Division of Public Safety has further increased security and support for religious, cultural, and other spaces where students gather on and near campus. At the same time, we will continue reaching out to leaders and groups across campus to offer support and inquire about their well-being.
We work in close partnership with our local, state, and federal partners to share information on protests, rallies, and other gatherings happening in the region, receiving multiple updates throughout the day. Public Safety will continue to attend gatherings to ensure the physical safety of participants and onlookers alike. Penn Police will take immediate action should there be any physical threat of harm and pursue it to the fullest extent of the law.
DPS members sit on the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and are in regular contact with Federal and other officials on these topics. We have reached out to our Federal partners for more information on how the new initiative will impact our ongoing working relationship. We will continue to work with our Law Enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the community which we serve.",Supporting our community in times of crisis,"“We are all members of the Penn community, and we all deserve to be heard and respected.
